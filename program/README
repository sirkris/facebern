This directory is used to store the executable that will be copied by the installer.  I put it here instead of the repo root because FaceBERN!.exe won't run without its dependency DLLs, which you'll need to either run the installer for or copy manually, and I didn't want there to be any confusion.

FaceBERN!.exe is NOT intended to be run from this directory!  It is automatically deleted by the installer, by default (disable by checking the "Include Source" box).

The build, itself, will be updated by me directly, at least for the time-being, as having multiple people do that cross-merging would kinda defeat the whole point of having a branching schema like this.

If you have write access to the repo, you are responsible for git-rebasing your branch on a freshly-pulled copy of develop immediately prior to merging!  Any merge conflicts you run into as a result of not doing this will be your responsibility to fix on your end.


Thanks!
